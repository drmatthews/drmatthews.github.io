# Dan's blog

This is being used to document all those things that I learn by googling but can never remember. I am a hobbyist programmer playing around with Django (a bit of Ruby on Rails) which means I need to remember some stuff about Postgresql, Javascript and CSS. In my professional life I have played around with Python for data analysis (having previously been a Matlab enthusiast) and OMERO.server related scripting and OMERO.web app development. I have also written a static website for the facility I manage ([nic.kcl.ac.uk](http://nic.kcl.ac.uk)) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a templating engine.

This blog was written using Jekyll using the Neo-HPSTR template. I like it because it looks snazzy and has some nice syntax highlighting.
